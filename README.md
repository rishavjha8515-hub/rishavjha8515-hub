# Hi, I’m Rishav 👋

I build open-source tools at the intersection of **quantum information**, **scientific visualization**, and **AI security** — focused on making advanced concepts accessible to students without institutional access.

## 🌍 Why I build
I’m a first-generation student without lab access. I publish openly so students like me can learn without paywalls or expensive resources.

## 🧠 Interests
Quantum information • decoherence & error correction • scientific visualization • AI safety
